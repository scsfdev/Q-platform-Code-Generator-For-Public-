The project will show how to generate SQRC, FrameQR and FrameQR-K from Q platform server.

For those who are interested, you may visit DENSO WAVE [Q platform page](https://www.denso-wave.com/en/system/qr/product/pratform.html) for more info.

This project was developed under Visual Studio 2017, Dot Net Framework 4.5.1, C# with MVVM Light.  
(Although MVVM Light is no more supported, but this is what I have currently, I am not able to upgrade to official Microsoft MVVM yet at the moment. Sorry about that. Next version I will upgrade it to official MVVM build.).

Kindly take note this project is to demonstrate how to consume the API functions (will not cover for programming best practices, some function calls maybe able to combine/shorten, and some calls maybe unnecessary, etc.).

> [!NOTE]
Please remember to input all your Q platform License details in "Project --> Properties --> Settings".  
Without Q platform License details, you will not be able to generate any code from this project.



Happy coding >> From Tin.
