The project will show how to generate SQRC, FrameQR and FrameQR-K from Q platform server.

THis project was developed under Visual Studio 2017, Dot Net Framework 4.5.1, C# with MVVM Light.

(Although MVVM Light is no more supported, but this is what I have currently, I am not able to upgrade to official Microsoft MVVM yet at the moment. Sorry about that. Next version I will upgrade it to official MVVM build.).

Please remember to input all your Q platform License details in "Project --> Properties --> Settings".
Without Q platform License details, you will not be able to generate any code from this project.

Happy coding >> From Tin.
